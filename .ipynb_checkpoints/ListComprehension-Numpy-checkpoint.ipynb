    "First, read the tutorial at: https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/list-comprehension\n",
    "\n",
    "Take the following list, below, and use list comprehension to complete the following. You must use list comprehension, and you mmust start with the original list (startList) each time. \n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Create a new list from every other element, starting at index 0\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Create a new list that contains True for each element in the original list that is even, False if it is odd\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) Create a new list that replaces the values in the original list with 1, 2 or 3 under the following conditions. If the value is less than 3, make the new value 1, if it's greater than or equal to 3. but below 6, make it equal to 2, otherwise make it 3\n",
    "\n",
    "(d) Use slicing to make a shallow copy of the complete list. To test, change one element of your new list, and print both lists. Make sure ONLY your new list changes (because lists are pass-by-reference)\n",
    "\n",
    "(e) Go through the list of lists contained in the variable data, and extract all elements from each list EXCEPT the last one, and put into a new list of lists. You must use list comprehension.\n",
    "\n",
    "e.g. the output should be: [[1, 2], [4, 5], [7, 8], [10, 11]]\n",
    "\n",
    "(f) Go through the list of lists contained in the variable data, and create a single list containing ONLY the last element of each nested list. You must use list comprehension.\n",
