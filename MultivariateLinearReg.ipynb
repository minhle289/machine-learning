    "For more complex learning, we cannot simply read our coefficients (b0 and b1 for SLR) from the data. We have to approximate them because there are many more of them. If you remember, the function for SLR was:\n",

    "y = b0 + b1*x\n",
    "\n",

We'll repeat this process for a number of iterations, minimizing the error each time.\n",

    "\n",
    "(a) We're going to use predictions made by our model as a guide for tuning the coefficients, we need a function that can make predictions. This function can also apply the final coefficients we have learned to make predictions over new data. Write a function called predict(instance, coefficients), that takes a single instance (a list of input features), and a list of coefficients, and calculates the predicted y value, using the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "y = b0 + b1*x1 + b2*x2 + ... + bN*xN\n",
    "\n",
    "This should work for ANY length of instance, but we can always assume that the length of the instance list and the length of the coefficent list are the SAME. For the instance, the values are:\n",
    "\n",
    "[x1,x2,x3,...,xN,Y] (where Y is the actual value, in the case of training, or None, in the case of testing).\n",
    "\n",
    "For the coefficients, let's assume that the list contains all the coefficients, including b0. Let's also assume that coefficients[0] is ALWAYS where we store b0. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your function predict(instance, coefficients) should return the predicted y value for a given instance and set of coefficients. \n",
    "\n",
    "(b) In the Simple Linear Regression assignment, you applied your model to a contrived data set. I've reproduced this below. Go through this data set one instance at a time and call your new predict function for each instance. You can use the coefficients [0.4, 0.8], which are almost exactly what you learned as coefficients in Assignment 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "For each instance, print out the correct value, and the value predicted by your function from (a). You should see that it performs reasonably well. "

    "        - (remember, each instance of the training data has the actual Y value)\n",
    "        - square the error, and add it to the total error. We're going to print the total error each time, and squaring the individual error means it will always be a positive value. NOTE: We don't use this squared error for updating the coefficients - we use the original error. This squaring is just to give us nice, readable output. \n",
    "        - Now update the coefficients, using the formulas given above. One update for b0 (which should always be at position 0 in the coefficients list), and then a series of updates for the remaining coefficients, b1 through bN.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    - At the end of each epoch, print out the epoch number (we can start at epoch 0), the learning rate, and the total error for this epoch.\n",
    "- once we've iterated through each epoch, return the list of coefficients\n",
    "\n",
    "(d) Apply your coefficientsSGD function to the contrived dataset, given below. If it's working, you should see the error rate falling each epoch. You should also note that the value of the coefficients learned isn't quite the same as Simple Linear Regression, because we're estimating each time. You could try learning longer (more epochs), or altering the learning rate, and see if the coefficients approach the optimal values we learned in Assignment 2. "

    "Here, the Multivariate Linear Regression performs only slightly better than the baseline algorithm zeroRR. This might be due to the fact that the the dataset is not balanced and there are much more normal wines than excellent or poor ones. Thus, the data may cluster around the mean more which makes zeroRR perform better than it usually does. "
